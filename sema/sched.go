// Each call to worker receives a unique id, from 0 up to count (exclusive count).

// In particular for Limit != 1, the order guarantee might be broken:
// While the invocation of worker(i) occurs before worker(j),
// no such guarantee for the first statement within those invocation is true.
//
// If an error occurs (indicated by a non-nil return from worker),
// Schedule waits for all ongoing worker calls to return.
// It may schedule further calls to worker, as determined by concurrency.Force.
// It then returns the non-nil error which triggered the error stop.
//
// If no error occurs, schedule returns nil.
